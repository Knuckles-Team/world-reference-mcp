"""Governed HTTP clients and a shared per-host rate limiter.

Every outbound request in this package goes through
``agent_connector_sdk.http.client``: bounded timeouts, TLS verification,
governed retry/backoff, and a redacted-URL logger. This module adds only what
the SDK's client does not: a cooperative minimum-interval limiter so this
process honours each vendor's documented request budget even though the SDK's
governed transport has no notion of a *source-specific* pace.
